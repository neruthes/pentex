# PenTeX

PenTeX is a package management frontend for Pandoc-compatible LaTeX [header files](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--include-in-header).
There are some occasions when writing raw LaTeX is overkill and the Pandoc default style is not good enough.
PenTeX is designed to fit into the gap.

Here is the link to the [full documentation](https://pub-714f8d634e8f451d9f2fe91a4debfa23.r2.dev/keep/pentex/PenTeX.md.pdf--2a9fea6c2d01022937414d7dd56ab743.pdf).

You can build the full documentation PDF with the following command:

```sh
./make.sh test
